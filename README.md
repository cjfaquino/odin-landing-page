# odin-landing-page

The goal for me with this project was to recreate [this](https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/odin-project.png) image using my current knowledge of html and css.

Things I focused on here:
- Flexbox properties
- Creating a easily readable css file
